## The Sakila Database

One of the best example databases out there is the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/">Sakila Database</a>, which was originally created by MySQL and has been open sourced under the terms of the BSD License.

The Sakila database is a nicely normalised schema modelling a DVD rental store, featuring things like films, actors, film-actor relationships, and a central inventory table that connects films, stores, and rentals.
